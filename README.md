# SynJ
SynJ is an ImageJ toolbar menu, developed and maintained by Alessandro Moro, that starts from the basic idea of neurite and synapse detection in neuronal autaptic cultures. It is based on the MATLAB program SynD from Shmitz and Hjorth, 2011 “Automated analysis of neuronal morphology, synapse number and synaptic recruitment”.
